      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My journey in software development began in 2022 at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology,
        but my fascination with technology and computers has been a lifelong passion.
        Iâ€™m excited by the prospect of becoming a full stack developer and am constantly looking for opportunities to learn and grow,
        both personally and professionally.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from coding, I have a range of hobbies that help me stay balanced and motivated.
        I enjoy listening to podcasts, going on camping trips to enjoy nature, video games or board games with friends, and spending time with my dog.
        She's a 6-year-old rescue from the streets of Thailand who became a part of my life two years ago.
